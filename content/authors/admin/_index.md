I am a Graphics Hardware Engineer in the Image Processing Unit at Intel India. At present, I am working on a new algorithm for the placement of memories in design based on connectivity with ports, other memories, and standard cell logic in the design.  

On the side of fun, I like to cook food for friends. I also like to write poems from time to time. You can read some of these here. On weekends, I can be found in a quiet corner at some literary event in Bangalore. 

I graduated from IIT Roorkee in 2018, where I was advised by Dr. Anand Bulusu. During my time at IIT Roorkee, I have also had the pleasure to work with Dr. Sanjeev Manhas. For my hobby projects, I got to work on some interesting stuff at the Artificial Intelligence & Electronics Section, IEEE Student Branch, and Mobile Development Group at IIT Roorkee. 

Over my bachelor’s, I have had the opportunity to explore many fields, ranging from Analog circuits, CMOS Devices to delay modeling in digital circuits. I also got to work on Industry research problems during my Internship at STMicroelectronics with Mr. Pratap Narayan Singh and during my major thesis at IIT Roorkee.

I like interacting with my juniors. I had the opportunity of serving as a Teaching Assistant for the course ‘Semiconductor Devices’ twice and a mentor in the Institute’s Student mentorship program for freshmen undergrads.
