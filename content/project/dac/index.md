title: Timing Calibration Algorithm for Interleaved Current Steering DAC
summary: A feedback algorithm for removing timing mismatch problems and improving SNR of interleaved current steering DAC structures clocked at high frequency (in GHz). The algorithm developed was tested to remove the timing errors at 4GHz frequency within a margin of 0.1% and improve the SNR by more than 24 dB and ENoB (Effective no. of  bits) by more than 4 bits.
