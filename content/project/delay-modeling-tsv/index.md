title: Cell Delay modeling for TSV induced stress in 3D ICs
summary: A holistic model to determine the threshold voltage and mobility changes around a TSV, and thus, delay through an inverter and a 2 input NAND gate. The final model needed coordinates of the cell to calculate the propagation delay.
